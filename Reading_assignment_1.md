Reading Assignment One : I chose EMNLP: "Elephant in the Room: On the Uniqueness of Sentence Embeddings" by Sergey Edunov et al. 

Overall, "Elephant in the Room: On the Uniqueness of Sentence Embeddings" examines the unique characteristics of sentence embeddings, which are mathematical representations of sentences used in NLP tasks. The authors argue that current methods of obtaining sentence embeddings, such as averaging word embeddings, may not accurately capture the meaning of a sentence due to the context-free nature of the representation. The paper shows through experiments that simple manipulations, such as negating or switching words within a sentence, can lead to similar sentence embeddings, despite the change in meaning. The authors conclude that better methods are needed to create sentence embeddings that more accurately capture the meaning of a sentence.

***The problem*** the authors are trying to address the issue that current methods for obtaining sentence embeddings, such as averaging word embeddings, do not accurately capture the meaning of a sentence and lead to representations that are context-free and lack uniqueness. The authors aim to shed light on the limitations of current sentence embedding methods and suggest that better methods are needed to create more accurate representations that capture the meaning of a sentence.

So, What kind of ***Solutions that they end up using***, afterall?

The authors of the paper "Elephant in the Room: On the Uniqueness of Sentence Embeddings" do not propose a new solution for obtaining sentence embeddings. Instead, the paper serves as a critique of current sentence embedding methods, such as averaging word embeddings, and highlights the limitations of these methods in accurately capturing the meaning of a sentence. The authors aim to bring attention to the need for better methods to create more unique and context-sensitive sentence embeddings, but they do not provide a specific solution themselves.

**What are the results of this research?**

The results of the research in the paper "Elephant in the Room: On the Uniqueness of Sentence Embeddings" showed that current methods for obtaining sentence embeddings, such as averaging word embeddings, produce context-free representations that lack uniqueness. The authors conducted experiments to demonstrate that simple manipulations of a sentence, such as negating or switching words, can result in similar sentence embeddings despite the change in meaning. These results highlight the limitations of current sentence embedding methods and suggest that better methods are needed to create more unique and context-sensitive sentence embeddings.
