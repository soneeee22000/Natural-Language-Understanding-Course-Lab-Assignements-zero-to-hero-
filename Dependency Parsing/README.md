# ***A Fast and Accurate Dependency Parser using Neural Networks By Danqi Chen and Christopher D. Manning***

The paper presents a dependency parser that uses a neural network architecture and a transition-based approach to analyze the grammatical structure of sentences. The parser aims to achieve both high accuracy and fast parsing speed, making it suitable for use in large-scale NLP tasks. The authors evaluate the parser on several standard benchmark datasets, showing that it outperforms existing state-of-the-art dependency parsers in terms of parsing accuracy and speed. They also present an analysis of the parser's behavior and its impact on different types of sentences, providing insights into its strengths and weaknesses.

In summary, the paper "A Fast and Accurate Dependency Parser using Neural Networks" describes a neural network-based dependency parser that combines high accuracy and fast parsing speed, making it a useful tool for large-scale NLP tasks.

This Paper basically recap what proffessor have taught us over the week ; presents a new approach to dependency parsing, using dense word embeddings instead of sparse indicator features. This approach aims to address three issues with traditional parsers: poor feature generalization, slow parsing speed, and incomplete features. The authors train a neural network on word embeddings and part-of-speech and dependency labels, and find that their parser outperforms other parsers in terms of accuracy and speed.
